      I got started in web development by building websites and have since
      developed a passion for TypeScript and fullstack development. My current
      dev-stack includes <b>Next.js</b> and <b>React</b>. And I am trying to
      keep up-to-date by reading articles online, following much more
      experienced developers, and subscribing to bunch of newsletters.
